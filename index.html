    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My name is Reza (but people call me Khashi) and I'm 22 years old living in 
       King City, ON, Canada! I'm currently attending a coding bootcamp at UofT to 
       improve my coding skills and to hopefully become a full stack developer. My main 
       interests include working out, watching movies, gaming, and basketball. I'm a huge 
       raptors fan! Haha you're probably not even reading this anymore! I can say anything 
       I want! dfasjhkhkgfshjfkdhsfkjsdhjfksdfdshjfksdjlfldsdkjfnadjkasnjdkasdasjkdnaskja. 
       Anyways, here's a simple page of what I'm all about, how you can contact me, and my 
       previous work   </p>
